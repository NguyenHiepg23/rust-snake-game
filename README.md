# Rust Snake

I just clone [this repo](https://github.com/SLMT/rust-snake) and make some changes.

A snake game written in Rust.

## How To Run ?

First, install the Rust development evnironment from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (if you do not have one).

Second, just simply run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
cargo run
```

**Enjoy!**

## Game Controls & Rules

- Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the green snake.
- Eat the food to make the snake stronger (or longer).
- When the snake hits the border or itself, it dies.

## TODOs

- To have a better game-over screen
- To upgrade the crates's version
